# solidity-boilerplate

This is a template repository that serves as the basis for my Solidity based projects. You can use this as a starting point, and add on any other tools, like frontend e.g. SCSS, TailwindCSS etc. Do note that this boilerplate comes with React, so if you do use any other tools apart from that, you'll have to tweak a few things.

This includes:
- `Migrations` directory hosts your migration files
- `Tests` directory has an example file and uses Mocha/Chai
- `SRC/Components` directory to host the components to your applications frontend
- `SRC/Contracts` hosts your smart contracts
- `Truffle_Abis` will host the ABIs to your smart contracts
- `Truffle_Config` allows you to configure your project's settings to connect to a local environment tool like Ganache.
