# solidity-boilerplate

This is a template repository that serves as the basis for my Solidity projects. You can use this as a starting point, and add any other tools you feel are suited. Do note that this boilerplate comes with React, TailwindCSS, and Web3, so if you want to use any other tools apart from that, you'll have to tweak a few things yourself.

This includes:
- `Migrations` directory hosts your migration files
- `Tests` directory has an example file and uses Mocha/Chai
- `SRC/Components` directory to host the components to your applications frontend
- `SRC/Contracts` hosts your smart contracts
- `Truffle_Abis` will host the ABIs to your smart contracts
- `Truffle_Config` allows you to configure your project's settings to connect to a local environment tool like Ganache.
